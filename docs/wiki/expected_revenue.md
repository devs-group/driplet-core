## Personas

What types of users provide data?

- Passive income
- Own a crypto wallet \
  wallet users worldwide ~84 million in 2022 [@walletmarket]
- Supporter of blockchain projects

➡️ Estimated: 500k

::: {.notes}
Persona required to define the market size.
:::


## Data

What's the value of the data?

- First-party data can only view the user in the context of one company \
  Even Google figured that out and launched Privacy Sandbox with topics [@privacysandbox] \
  ➡️ **Cross-page** audiences and -interaction!
- Data from websites that do not collect and sell customer data

::: {.notes}
But actually hard to find and scale for more specific markets!
:::


## Product

- Audiences
- Media campaigns based on audiences
- Insights
  - Measured (campaign) results - Cookieless (impressions; reach and frequency)
  - Competitive analysis

::: {.notes}
- Personas may not be representative for competitiv analysis
- Maybe: User identification (Websites can identify users without them being logged in)
:::

## Backend Customers

Wer hat an den Produkten interesse?

- Advertisers (engage with customers that do not have a brand awareness!)
- eCommerce (competitiv analysis)
- Market researchers
- Companies that train AI Agents


## Challanges

- Proxy email addresses reduces retargeting via DMPs significantly [@hidemyemail]
- Hard findk and scaling of personas for a specific market


## Calculations

Based on previous considerations with a focus on established channels:

$$ \#users \times \#audiences \times retargeting \times value\_of\_user $$

#Nutzer x #Audiences x #Retargeting x #value x #customers

500k x 3 x 20% x 5 USD x 100 = 150M USD


::: {.notes}
Ignoring fees of selling data...

# Profit

## Frontend Customers

What are the benefits of customers providing data and how do we increase them?

- Aquisition costs

::: {.callout-warning}
Many users means that distribution must be divided among many. Therefore, a few targeted users are more relevant!
:::

::: {.notes}
Even if we can weight important customers in the distributions, this does not reduce the acquisition costs.
:::


## Operative Costs

- DMPs
- Agencies
